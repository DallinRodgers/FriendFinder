In this application the user will enter their name and answer ten personality questions. After they answer the questions their scores will be comparted to 7 potential friends. The server will then find which potential friend has the least amount of differences and return their information as a JSON object. 

The best match will then be displayed as a Bootstrap Modal to the user.
